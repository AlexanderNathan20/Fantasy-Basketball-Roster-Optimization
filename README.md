# Fantasy Basketball Roster Optimization

## Background
A Yahoo Fantasy 9-category 12-man league is a type of fantasy basketball league where you and 11 other people manage virtual teams of real NBA players. The league is called "9-category" because your team's success is measured by nine different statistical categories. Here's a breakdown to help you understand it better:

#### League Setup

Draft: At the start of the season, there's a draft where you take turns picking players from the NBA to fill your roster. This is like selecting your own dream team.

#### 9 Categories

Points: The total number of points your players score in games.

Rebounds: How many rebounds (when a player retrieves the ball after a missed shot) your players get.

Assists: The number of assists (when a player passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score) your players make.

Steals: How many times your players take the ball away from an opponent.

Blocks: The number of times your players stop an opponent's shot from going into the basket.

Field Goal Percentage: The percentage of shots your players make from the field (how efficient they are at scoring).

Free Throw Percentage: The percentage of free throws your players make (how well they shoot free throws).

Three-Pointers Made: The total number of successful three-point shots your players make.

Turnovers: The number of times your players lose possession of the ball to the other team (you want fewer of these).

#### How It Works

Weekly Matchups: Each week, your team is matched up against another team in the league. Your goal is to win in as many of the nine categories as possible.

Winning Categories: For example, if your team scores more points than your opponent's team that week, you win the "Points" category. If your players have fewer turnovers, you win that category too.

#### Scoring: The more categories you win in a week, the better your overall record becomes.

Season Goals

Playoffs: The league usually lasts for the regular NBA season, with the best-performing teams making it to the playoffs at the end.
